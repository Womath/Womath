- 👋 Hi, I’m @Womath
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of stuff. I love anime and japan culture, Formula 1, a variety of musics, and playing darts. I love reading, traveling, hiking,
and basically anything that doesn't involve a large group of people. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java. I threw away my previous job just to give myself enough time and maximum concentration to learn this programming language,
and to be able to work in this sector after I successfully learned it. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now. I am learning. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
